NodeRed Flows and other SmartHome snippets to share

Have a look inside the subdirectories to see the local readme.md for details

Tipp: When I went beyond Node Red and wanted to add InfluxDB & Grafana I found [this video](https://haus-automatisierung.com/nodered/2021/12/14/node-red-daten-in-influxdb2.html) helpful. But I am sure there are many more out there.
